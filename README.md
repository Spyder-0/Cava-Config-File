# [Cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) Config File âš™
My C.A.V.A Config File. Feel free to use it as you like! The theme I used here is [`Catppuccin Mocha`](https://github.com/catppuccin/cava). Check out their repo if you only want the theme. C.A.V.A is a console based audio visualizer, and it's very customisable and cool to watch while you play music. Don't forget to also check out [C.A.V.A's](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) repo too!
